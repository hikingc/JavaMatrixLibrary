///
/// @param filter The ID of a filter created using the filter API or a filter JSON object encoded as
///   a [String].
/// @param fullState Controls whether to include the full state for all rooms the user is a member
///   of. The default is `false`.
/// @param setPresence Controls whether this client is automatically marked as online by polling
///   this API. If this parameter is omitted then this client is automatically marked as online when
///   it uses this API. Otherwise, if the parameter is set to `offline` then the client is not
///   marked as being online when it uses this API. When set to `unavailable`, the client is marked
///   as being idle.
/// @param since A point in time to continue a sync from. This should be the `next_batch` token
///   returned by an earlier call to this endpoint.
/// @param timeout The maximum time to wait, in milliseconds, before returning this request. Default
///   is 0
/// @param useStateAfter Controls whether to receive state changes between the **previous sync and
///   the start of the timeline**, or **between the previous sync and the end of the timeline**.
/// @see <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#filtering">Filter spec details
