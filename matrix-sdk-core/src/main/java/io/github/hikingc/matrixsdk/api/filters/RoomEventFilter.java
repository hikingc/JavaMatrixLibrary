/// Holds additional granular filters for events in a room.
///
/// @param containsUrl if `true`, includes only events with a [URI] key in their content. If
///   `false`, excludes those events. If omitted, [URI] key is not considered for filtering.
/// @param includeRedundantMembers if `true`, sends all membership events for all events, even if
///   they have already been sent to the client. Does not apply unless `lazyLoadMembers` is `true`.
///   Defaults to `false`.
/// @param lazyLoadMembers if `true`, enables lazy-loading of membership events. Defaults to
///   `false`.
/// @param limit the maximum number of events to return, must be an integer greater than 0.
///
///   Servers should apply a default value, and impose a maximum value to avoid resource exhaustion.
/// @param notRooms a [List] of room IDs to exclude. If this [List] is absent then no rooms are
///   excluded. A matching room will be excluded even if it is listed in the `rooms` filter.
/// @param notSenders a [List] of sender IDs to exclude. If this [List] is absent then no senders
///   are excluded. A matching sender will be excluded even if it is listed in the senders filter.
/// @param notTypes a [List] of event types to exclude. If this [List] is absent then no event types
///   are excluded. A matching type will be excluded even if it is listed in the `types` filter. A
///   "*" can be used as a wildcard to match any sequence of characters.
/// @param rooms a [List] of room IDs to include. If this [List] is absent then all rooms are
///   included.
/// @param senders a [List] of senders IDs to include. If this [List] is absent then all senders are
///   included.
/// @param types a [List] of event types to include. If this [List] is absent then all event types
///   are included. A "*" can be used as a wildcard to match any sequence of characters.
/// @param unreadThreadNotifications if true, enables per-thread notification counts. Only applies
///   to the [Event#(QueryParametersSync)] endpoint. Defaults to `false`.
/// @see <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.19/client-server-api/#lazy-loading-room-members">Documentation about Lazy-loading room members.</a>
